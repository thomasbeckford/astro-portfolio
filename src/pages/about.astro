            I'm a <strong>software engineer</strong> passionate about building things,
            with a focus on <strong>frontend development</strong>. Born in
            November 1989 and originally from <strong
              >Argentina, Buenos Aires</strong
            >, my primary language is Spanish, though I also speak English at an
            upper-intermediate (B2) level.
            <strong>Currently, I live in the UK</strong> on a work visa. With experience
            in full-stack web and mobile development, I'm working on several projects,
            including <a
              href="https://soymenu.com"
              class="font-bold text-blue-500"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              aria-label="Visit SoyMenu -
            my restaurant menu project"
              >SoyMenu</a
            > (<span class="italic">https://soymenu.com</span>), a personal
            project that has been in production since 2019.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-400 text-xl">
            Always eager to learn, grow, and collaborate as a developer, I also
            have an interest in crypto and blockchain. While I'm not an expert,
            I've had the opportunity to work on projects like Spiritswap (a DeFi
            project) and at Fuel, where we worked with NFTs, gaining valuable
            knowledge in the space.

              not only entertains me but also helps me improve my strategic
              thinking and problem-solving skills.</strong
